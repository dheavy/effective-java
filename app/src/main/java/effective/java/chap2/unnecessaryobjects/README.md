# Avoid creating unnecessary objects

Donâ€™t create a new object when you should reuse an existing one.

It is often appropriate to reuse a single object instead of creating a new functionally equivalent object each time it is needed.

Reuse can be both faster and more elegant.

An object can always be reused if it is immutable.
